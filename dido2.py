#How best can  I put it,you think you've found love only to realise it is all fun and game for them.
#Your ex shows up at this tym but because you found new love you push them away...
# Huh!! then boom heart break
#The tym you need them back(ex)he has long moved on.....just where do broken hearts go!!
#Then you are left to deal with your emotions back and forth...you look at all the possible option
#The best is to study study and study much more
#Just where do broken hearts go!!
